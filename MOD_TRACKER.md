## Known Systemic Issues

| Root Cause | Affected Mods |
|---|---|
| `prodigy.giftBoxController` removed from prodigy object; not in gameContainer either | Obtain Conjure Cubes; Conjure Cubes step in Max Account / Hypermax Account |
| Battle is server-authoritative in `SecureBattleRevamp` — no client-side victory/heal method | Win Battle, Heal Team |
| `battleData` module not discoverable in gameContainer binding map | Get all Runes, Runes portion of Hypermax Account |
| `pvpNetworkHandler` not present on prodigy object | Arena Point Increaser |
| `debugMisc.disableTimeoutDialogue` not present | Disable Timeout Dialog |

**Resolved (2026-04-13):** `_.constants` undefined — replaced with FlagProvider service `"35d-3bd9"` (`.set(key, value)` / `.get(key)`). Fixes Disable Math, Skip Enemy Turn, Disable Monster Encounters, Disable Inactivity Kick. Battle state rename — Escape Battle now handles `SecureBattleRevamp` via `state._battleController.escapeBattle()`. Toggle Membership rewritten against service `"859-25be"` with `isMember` getter override.

## Player Mods

| Mod | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Max Account** | ⚠️ Partial | Gold, level, bounty, achievements, items, pets, equipment all work. Conjure Cubes step fails silently (giftBoxController missing). |
| **Set Gold** | ✅ Working | Sets `player.data.gold`. Verified 9,999,999. |
| **Set Level** | ✅ Working | Sets level + recalculates stars. |
| **Get member stars** | ✅ Working | Sets `player.data.storedMemberStars`. |
| **Set Bounty Points** | ✅ Working | Sets `player.data.bountyScore`, capped at 100. |

| **Toggle membership** | ⚠️ In progress | Rewritten against service `"859-25be"` with instance-level `isMember` getter override (`Object.defineProperty(ms, 'isMember', { get: () => true })`). Fix in progress — verify live. |
| **Set name (Client side only)** | ✅ Working | Overrides `player.getName()`. Client-side only, reverts on reload. |
| **Change Name** | ✅ Working | Edits `player.name.data.firstName/middleName/lastName/nickname`. |

## Inventory Mods

| Mod | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Item stacker** | ✅ Working | All 13 item categories populated. Removes bounty notes. |
| **Clear inventory** | ✅ Working | `Object.keys(player.backpack.data).forEach(d => player.backpack.data[d] = [])` clears all 13 categories. Verified. |
| **Selector (Basic)** | ✅ Working | All 13 item categories accessible from `_.gameData`. |
| **Selector (Advanced)** | ✅ Working | Fixed 2026-04-13: else branch now sets quantity `N = amt.value` on the existing item. |
| **Obtain All Furniture** | ✅ Working | Fixed 2026-04-13: duplicate button removed; single entry honors user-specified amount. |

| Mod | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **WASD Movement** | ✅ Working | Toggler sets `useWASD` flag. `player._playerContainer.walkSpeed` accessible. Starts enabled by default (`.status = true`). |

---

| **Get All Mythical Epics** | ✅ Working | IDs 158,164–171,189. 10 epics found in gameData and added. |

## Battle Mods

> Most battle mods were tested outside of battle. State-dependent results noted. Current battle state system uses `SecureBattleRevamp` instead of the `Battle`/`SecureBattle` states the code was written for.

| Mod | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Disable math [PvP, PvE]** | ✅ Working | Fixed 2026-04-13: uses FlagProvider service `"35d-3bd9"` → `set("GameConstants.Debug.EDUCATION_ENABLED", false)`. |
| **Instant Kill [PvE]** | ✅ Working | Sets `player.modifiers.damage` to `VERY_LARGE_NUMBER`. No battle state required. |
| **PvP Health [PvP]** | ✅ Working | Sets `player.pvpHP` and overrides `player.getMaxHearts`. No battle state required. |
| **Escape Battle [PvP, PvE]** | ✅ Working | Fixed 2026-04-13: PvE branch handles `SecureBattleRevamp` via `state._battleController.escapeBattle()`. PvP/CoOp paths unchanged. |
| **Win Battle [PvE]** | 🔒 Patched | Server-authoritative; no client-side victory method available in `SecureBattleRevamp`. Archived in `patchedMods.ts`. |
| **Set Battle Hearts [PvP, PvE]** | ✅ Working | Sets `player.getMaxHearts`, `pvpHP`, and `player.data.hp`. No battle state required. |
| **Fill Battle Energy [PvP, PvE]** | ⏭️ Not tested | Requires being in battle. Logic calls `game.state.getCurrentState().teams[0].setEnergy(99)` — not testable from overworld. |
| **Skip enemy turn** | ✅ Working | Fixed 2026-04-13: uses FlagProvider `"35d-3bd9"` → `set("GameConstants.Battle.SKIP_ENEMY_TURN", true)`. |
| **Heal Team [PvE]** | 🔒 Patched | Server-authoritative; `player.heal()` no longer drives server state mid-battle. Archived in `patchedMods.ts`. |

---

## Minigame Mods

| Mod | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **69x Walk Speed [Dyno Dig]** | ✅ Working | `game.state.states.get("DinoDig").walkSpeed` is writable. Must be inside DinoDig for the change to have visual effect. |

---

## Miscellaneous Mods

| Mod | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Skip Tutorial** | ✅ Working | `world.getZone("house"/"academy").testQuest()` accessible. |
| **Disable Monster Encounters** | ✅ Working | Fixed 2026-04-13: uses FlagProvider `"35d-3bd9"` → `set("GameConstants.Debug.SCALE_ENCOUNTER_DISTANCE", 0)`. |
| **Unlimited Spins** | ✅ Working | Overrides `player.canSpin` function. Restores original on disable. |
| **Reset Account** | ⏭️ Not tested | Destructive and irreversible. |
| **[Fix] Fix Battle Crash** | ✅ Working | Calls `assignRandomSpells()` on all pets in team. |

### Priority Fixes

_Recorded 2026-04-13 after repair sweep._

1. **`giftBoxController` missing** — Find new path or remove Conjure Cubes from Max/Hypermax Account. Fixes 1 broken mod, improves 2 partial.
2. **`battleData` module** — Get all Runes and Hypermax runes step cannot find the module. Discovery logic needs a new shape function.
